<h2>I've worked with a few other groups in the past, I once worked with a Pokemon Brick Bronze remake, making animations for pokeball throwing, battle animations, etc. The group has been shutdown and the owner, Rattata2001, banned. I also have worked with a war group previously, but I couldn't find which group was it, I still have the physical animations, and another group about a karate game, I made animations for kicks, punches, jumps and other techniques, I know how to deal with both R6 and R15, and I use the Roblox Animator plugin, but I've used Moon Animator before. I've also worked with groups like: Jitsoft Studios, 8-bit Community.
